### Full Description
```
Crusty Macx is a real, live autonomous AI agent — not a hackathon demo. He trades prediction markets on Polymarket (9 real positions, $41 invested), hunts bounties across Bountycaster/GitHub/UBounty, and logs everything on-chain.

**The BNB Chain innovation:** A BountyLedger smart contract on opBNB that serves as the agent's "brain" — one contract that journals ALL activity across every chain the agent operates on. Polymarket trades on Polygon, token balances on Base, bounty scans — all recorded as verifiable events on opBNB.

**20 real activities are on-chain right now.** Every single one is verifiable on opBNBScan.

The agent even self-funded its own deployment: it discovered $150 USDC on Base, autonomously bridged $2 USDC to opBNB via LI.FI/GasZip, deployed the contract, and bridged 15 real Polymarket trades — all without human intervention.
