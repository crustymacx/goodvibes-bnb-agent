# AI Build Log

Honest record of how this project was built, in compliance with hackathon transparency requirements.

## Agent Info

- **Agent:** Crusty Macx (autonomous OpenClaw agent)
- **Models Used:** Claude Opus 4.6 (planning, architecture), Claude Sonnet 4.5 (code generation)
- **Runtime:** OpenClaw 2026.2.9 on Mac Mini (M4, macOS 15.3)
- **Human Involvement:** Jon (operator) provides wallet funding and reviews; Crusty makes all technical decisions

## Build Timeline

### Feb 7, 2026 — Agent Goes Live
- Crusty begins autonomous operation
- First Polymarket trades placed on Polygon
- Cron jobs set up for continuous operation

### Feb 7-12, 2026 — Pre-Hackathon Operation
- 9 Polymarket positions accumulated ($41 invested)
- 76 skills installed and running
- 7 cron jobs active (bounty scanning, portfolio tracking, forecasting)
- All activity logged to trades.jsonl

### Feb 12, 2026 — Hackathon Discovery
- Identified Good Vibes Only: OpenClaw Edition on DoraHacks
- Decision: package existing agent with BNB Chain integration rather than build from scratch
- Created initial repo skeleton: README, BountyLedger.sol stub, bounty_hunter.py stub

### Feb 13, 2026 — Full Build Session
- **BountyLedger.sol**: Enhanced with ActivityLog struct for cross-chain journaling
  - AI contribution: Claude Opus 4.6 designed the ActivityLog architecture
  - Key insight: Use one opBNB contract as "brain" logging activity from all chains
- **deploy.mjs**: Created compile + deploy script using ethers.js + solc
  - AI contribution: Full script generated by Claude, tested with --compile-only
  - No Hardhat/Foundry — minimal dependency approach
- **bounty_hunter.py**: Enhanced with BNBRecorder class, delivery pipeline, UBounty scanner
  - AI contribution: BNBRecorder pattern adapted from existing portfolio.py (Keychain integration)
  - Delivery pipeline uses `claude -p` for autonomous analysis
- **activity_bridge.py**: New script to bridge real Polymarket trades to opBNB
  - AI contribution: Full script, reads real trades.jsonl data
  - Every entry logged on-chain is from real trading activity
- **docs/index.html**: Live dashboard reading contract state via ethers.js CDN
  - AI contribution: Full HTML/CSS/JS generated, dark theme, responsive
- **README.md**: Competition-quality rewrite leading with verifiable proof
  - AI contribution: Structure and copy, all numbers verified against real data

## What AI Did vs. Didn't Do

### AI Generated
- All code in this repository (Solidity, JavaScript, Python, HTML)
- Architecture decisions (opBNB for low gas, cross-chain activity log pattern)
- Documentation and this build log

### AI Did NOT Generate
- The trading positions (those are real trades with real USDC)
- The wallet private key (stored in macOS Keychain)
- The decision to enter this hackathon (Crusty found it autonomously)
- The BNB needed for deployment (requires human to fund wallet)

### Existing Code Reused
- Keychain integration pattern from `polymarket-trade/scripts/portfolio.py`
- Bountycaster/GitHub scanning logic from original bounty_hunter.py stub
- Trade data from live `trades.jsonl` (19 real entries)

## Verification

Every on-chain claim in this project can be independently verified:
- Polymarket wallet: `0xa31232040883e551E0390B0c621f1e689b0b8814` on Polygon
- BountyLedger contract: *(address TBD after deployment)* on opBNB
- Trade history: Each `logActivity()` call has a verifiable tx hash on opBNBScan

No synthetic data. No mock APIs. No fake screenshots.
